## What is this?

A collection of projects required by FreeCodeCamp.com.  Projects are completed using html, css, javascript.


## Why would I do this?

Upon completion of a number of these projects, I can claim a "certificate" that shows my apparent worth, allowing
me to be able to help non profit organizations by coding for them.
